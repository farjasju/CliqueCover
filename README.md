## The Problem
### What's a Clique?
Graphs (also called networks) are composed of *nodes* (or *vertices*) that are related by *edges* (or *links*). A **clique** is a set of nodes in which each node is linked to every other node - you can think of it as a highly cohesive group.
### The Minimum Clique Cover Problem

Finding a **clique cover** of a graph means covering the graph with cliques, so that each node belongs to a clique. Finding a **minimum clique cover** means finding how to cover the graph with a minimum number of cliques.
